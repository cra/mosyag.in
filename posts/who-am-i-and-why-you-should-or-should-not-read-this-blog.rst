I had infrequent request to start logging my thoughts in a more static form hence this blog. This is a collection of my own observartions, quite biased and probably not politically-correct or anything like that.

A few things to consider before continuing reading this
=======================================================

1. Mainly, the content here is (about to) feature random technical notes on programming and computers in general. Most likely it won't be comprehensive for anyone except me or without context.
   
2. I like to experiment on myself in lifestyle design. Obviously, it means that I would drop a few lines about it from time to time. Due to my extremelly biased technical worldview, I tend to call it "mind/body hacks". The main reason behind starting this blog is a log of my transition to a polyphasic sleeping pattern.

3. Most likely, my tastes in music are different from yours. This shouldn't be a problem.

4. I'm antireligious and omnivorous. Though, I do have a strong dislike towards baked carrots and think of them as a pure evil.

5. English is not my first languague, so it is reasonable to expect a frequent drop of articles or glitchy grammar. One of the reasons I'm writing this blog is to improve my writing skills, so feel free to correct me by creating an issue on github or by email.
