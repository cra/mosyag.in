This summer I've decided to try polyphasic sleep one more time. My schedule is going to be stable for a while and I have no travelling plans for the next few weeks, which should be enough to get through the most of adaptation period. My plan is to blog for a while before and during adaptation phase. In this post I outline a few definitions that I'm going to refer to later on. This is partially to log my current understanding of the things and to potentially see if they need to change in the future.

This is not my first attempt at it and I have done the similar experiments in the past, but none of them lasted long enough (but only partially due to my failure to go through adaptation period).

This is by no means anything new, I read most of it on the `specific subreddit <http://reddit.com/r/polyphasic>`_ and in the `"Ubersleep" book <http://www.ubersleepbook.com/>`_ by `puredoxyk <www.puredoxyk.com>`_. I highly recommend the book, it's a fun and entertaining read. The subreddit is not very vibrant, though.

So, definitions!

1. **Slow Wave Sleep** or **SWS** -- one of the two main modes of sleeping, this is the one when you're zombie-like if you waken up abruptly.

2. **Rapid eye movement sleep** or **REM** -- the other mode of sleeping. This is the one when most of the dreams suppose to occur. If you been waken up while being in this phase, you should feel rephreshed and remember your dreams (at least for a while).

3. **Nap** is a short sleep session (usually less than 45 minutes, most commonly 20). On the nap-only schedule, both SWS and REM occurs during naps. Your body, supposedly, learns how to squeeze as much as it can from this short sleep sessions.

4. **Core** refers to a longer sleep session (at least 45 minutes, up to 4.5 hours). Most of the schedules include at least one core, with the aim to get at least a couple of SWS cycles in. If your core sleep is longer than 4.5 hours, it's not really considered a polyphasic regime.

5. **Circadian rhythm** -- A term for daytime-related placement of time intervals. Example might be something like "sleep for a couple of hours right after sunset" or "have a short nap at noon".

6. **Ultradian rhythm** -- A term for relative placement of time intervals, like "have a nap every two hours for two days in a row" or "have a 90 minutes sleep session after every 4.5 hours of wake-time".

7. **Schedule** -- in context of sleep, a projection of ultradian-aligned combination of core(s) and naps aligned with specific circadian rhythm recomendations. Example schedule: "4 hour core from 22:00 to 02:00, three 20 minute naps at 5:00, 12:00, 19:00".

8. **Adaptation** -- the period of sleep-deprivation when one switches a schedule (usually from monophasic, *e.g.* regular 7-9 hour at night, every night). If there's a sequence of schedule changes, the adaptation considered to last until you reach and able to maintain your target schedule comfortably. This process can take from a couple of weeks up to a couple of months. Obviously, it depends on a target schedule, but one should always consider multiple other factors, such as diet, schedule adherence, potential ilnesses, stress level and substances abuse. Usually one's aim is to get through adaptation as fast as possible.

The main idea behind the polyphasic sleep is that you can train your body (in a process of adaptation) to sleep more efficient. The regular monophasic sleep considered to constist of multiple sleep cycles including a couple of SWS cycles, a few REM cycles and a bunch of "dull" sleep. Nobody knows if those "dull" sleep cycles are important, though, so it should not be taken for granted. By napping efficientl, you aim to have only SWS and REM modes during your sleep sessions. There are two main schedules, that are considered to be well-tested and a bunch of modifications of them. I'll outline them in my next post.
