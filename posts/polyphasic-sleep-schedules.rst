Basically, there are two principally different polyphasic schedules: naps-only and naps-and-core. Historically, the first one is called "Uberman" and features 20 minutes naps every four hours and an almost impossible adaptation period. The other one is called "Everyman" and has a longer sleep session called core and a few naps. The amount of naps depends on the length of a core.

There are a few rules on how the naps should be located, the so-called "Formula" (although, in my opinion it shouldn't be called that. It's rather a "set of recommendations").

Set of recommendations (Formula)
================================

1. Every nap should be less than 30 minutes

2. Core sleep session should last integer number of 90 minutes. The 90 minutes thing is, of course an average and on practice the exact value is highly individual. Some people claim that a cycle as short as 45 minute is sufficient.
  
3. Ideally, there shouldn't be more than 6 hours between naps, or one would accumulate tiredness.

The other things I've seen mentioned on forums:

* It's good to place core in such a way that either start of it occurs with dusk, or the end with dawn. This help with SWS sleep.

* There are schedules with multiple cores, but those tend to be even harder to maintain in the real world.

* You should be as strict as possible with your naps during adaptation period.

* If adaptation fails, have a week or two replenishing your energy. Jumping into next attempt straight after a failed one might result in an even more discomfort.


Adaptation strategy
===================

Depending on a schedule, the sleep deprivation would be either acute but short, or rather moderate but longer. One possible strategy might be to go cold turkey and start sleeping polyphasically on a target schedule straight away. The obvious culpit is that it require a lot of discipline to not oversleep and to have all naps on time. The other strategy is to gradually shift from monophasic to target schedule, cutting your night sleep and introducing naps. One example of such gradual adaptation can be read `here <http://hardcoretrainingsolutions.com/polyphasic-sleep/>`_. I'm planning to do something similar. 

It seems that it is easier to adapt if you start sleep-deprived already. The reasoning behind this is that your body would more likely to start using naps as a recharge if you feel more tired. The possible strategy for this called "Naptation" and consist of three distinc phases: 1) you start by staying awake for as long as possible (24 hours is considered to be 'long enough' with 36 hours being the recommended norm); 2) for a couple of days, you sleep for 20 minutes every two hours; 3) after that, you go uberman for as long as you can; 4) you switch to your target schedule.

I believe the reasoning behind 'Naptation' makes sense, but I don't like it. There are people reporting to be able to adapt to a schedule this way, and it seems possible if you put the "sleep for 20 minutes every two hours" part over the long weekend, but for me it sounds like the risk of oversleeping during Uberman part is too high. You're basically making yourself sleep deprived twice: once in the beginning, and once on uberman before switching to a target schedule.

My target schedule and adaptation strategy
==========================================

Well, my target schedule for this time is what I consider a "relaxed" Everyman with 4.5 hours core and two naps. This amounts to a roughly 5.5 total hours of sleep, and the schedule considered to be easy to adapt and, well, not extreme. To be on a safe side, I'm going to start by sleeping for 6 hours for a few days with a 20 minute lunch nap (a so-called "Biphasic" schedule). This is also a way to force myself into bed at desired time and to figure logistics for napping at lunch time. Once I feel like I'm ready, I'll cut the night sleep to 4.5 hours and introduce two naps, one in the morning and one around 16:00.


+------+-------------+-------------+
|Stage | Biphasic    | Everyman    |
+======+=============+=============+
| Core | 00:00-06:00 | 00:00-04:30 |
+------+-------------+-------------+
| Nap1 | 13:00-13:20 | 10:00-10:30 |
+------+-------------+-------------+
| Nap2 | (None)      | 16:00-16:30 |
+------+-------------+-------------+

I assume 30 minutes to account for additional time it takes to get comfortable and to wake up and get back to my workplace. Moreover, during adaptation I'm going to 1) drop coffee as well as black/green tea; 2) have my diet as clean as possible and 3) Have no devices for the last awake hour before my core starts. These are general recommendations I heard for the adaptation phase.

So, the schedule has been covered. As for additional issues with preparation, I'll outline them in my next post.
