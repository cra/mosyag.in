Adaptation to a polyphaisc schedule is a challenge (some people known to take it just for the sake of it). Basically, you're trying to mess up with one of the basic human functions -- sleep, and your body would try to stop you. On a naps+core schedule, naps are mainly REM-phases. Therefore, they clear the head and provide mental refresh, not physical recovery. If one requires physical recovery, for example, due to regular exercise, it is usually benefitial to get as much SWS as one can[#]_.

Anyway, coreless schedule or not, one ends with a lot of awkwardly-placed time periods. Depending on a schedule, it's either a few hours of lonely silence at night, or a couple of hours in early morning. If you don't have anything to do, you get bored and might end up sleeping because that's what people do when bored. While having additional naps is not that much of an issue once adapted, it might screw up the transition period. It is a good idea to create a few documents (lists and other types of memos) to either 1) remind yourself why you're doing it 2) give you an idea what you can do *right now* (that is not sleeping).

Basically, here's an (incomplete) list of things one should have on hand during adaptation:

* The Big Fat List[#]_. Basically, a huge todo-list of things to do, just a mind dump of every possible thing you want to do, as tangible as possible. It's better to have multiple "

* Backup todo list. This is a list of things you should consider doing if you're super tired. The idea is that since the big fat list is, well, Big, you might get frustrated if you look at it during acute sleep-deprivation.

* A few paragraphs with various reminders on why you are doing what you're doing. In `her book <http://www.ubersleepbook.com/>`_, puredoxyk recommends to have a few copies of this list placed in "strategical places".

* A short list entitled "What I'm doing before leaving for work", with a list of things like "put on pants" and "take the office key". It's easy to forget the obvious stuff when you're severely sleep deprived.

* A short list entitled "Do you want to sleep? Do a few of these first". This is an emergency list, which should feature some activities that can be done before you are crashing the bed with this "ah, screw this" feeling. It should be short, doable and energetic. I had "do 10 push-ups" in my list during my last adaptotion. This definetely saved me a few times.

* A reminder list entitled "Why I am doing this", with all the reasons why this suffering worth it. Or maybe it can be something like "What I would get if I get through this"

Anyway, I set up an [example repository](https://github.com/cra/One-page-latex-templates) with a few examples based on a template I use for most of my lists.


.. [#] I'm not sure how that works on nap-based schedules, I assume the body manages to get SWS during short 20 minutes naps. I plan to continue exercise so I'm not really interested in nap-only schedules for noww
.. [#] The term is coined by `puredoxyk <www.puredoxyk.com>`_. Well, as well as the other fun names in polyphasic community :)
